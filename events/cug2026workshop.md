# HPC System Test Workshop - 2026 HPCTESTATHON (Follow-up Edition)

## Details
* **When**: 25, April 2026, held in conjunction with CUG 2026
* **Where**: Observatoire de la côte d'Azur, Site du Mont-Gros, Boulevard de l’Observatoire, 06304, Nice
* **Format**: One-day, in-person workshop

## Description

This workshop brings together HPC experts, system engineers, and vendors to continue discussions on how HPC systems are tested, building on the first HPCTestathon held at CUG 2024.

As HPC systems become more complex, with mixed architectures, AI workloads, and energy constraints, testing is no longer just about running more tests. HPC centers need to better understand which tests are truly useful, when to run them, and how test results help day-to-day operations over the lifetime of a system.

HPCTestathon 2026 is a follow-up event that builds on the work started in 2024, while giving participants space to introduce new challenges, test cases, and emerging topics. The workshop focuses on sharing real-world experience and structured group discussions, with the goal of capturing practical insights that can be reused by the wider HPC community.

## Goals

The overall objective of this event is to continue the open cataloging and sharing of HPC system tests, building on the outcomes of previous editions and on participant-driven recommendations. It also aims to foster open discussions on the challenges associated with each testing sub-theme, and to encourage structured reflection guided by testing areas.

## Focus Areas

In addition to the focus areas addressed in 2024 (applications, file systems, node health, performance, schedulers, continuous testing), HPCTestathon 2026 will introduce **new themes reflecting emerging challenges**, including:

* Energy Measurement and Energy-Related Testing
* AI / ML Benchmarking and Validation

## Program

HPCTestathon 2026 is a **one-day event** structured as follows:

### Saturday morning, April 25, 2026: Experience Sharing

The goal of the morning sessions is to **share lessons learned, challenges, and practical insights**.

**9:15 - 9:30: Welcome coffee**

**9:30 - 11:00: Experience Sharing**

*Format: 10-minute presentation + 5-minute Q&A*

**12:30 – 14:00: Lunch break**  

Buffet lunch on the Panoramic Terrace, with free access to the museum (guide available).

### Saturday afternoon, April 25, 2026: Working Groups

**14:00 - 14:30: Demonstration of the movement of the Eiffel Dome and the giant telescope**

**14:30 - 17:00: Working in groups: different aspects of HPC testing environment**

Participants will be divided into working groups focusing on key aspects of HPC system testing. Each group will explicitly **build on the existing test lists** (provided in the [working-groups](https://git.cines.fr/external/Testathon-cug-2026/-/tree/main/working-groups?ref_type=heads) folder files), refining them based on current needs. 

Discussions will be guided by a small, common set of questions, defined in advance with the working group leaders, in order to structure the exchanges  while preserving open discussion.

**17:00 - 17:30: Conclusions and Results**

## Connect with the HPC System Test Community

This workshop is organized as part of the **HPC System Test Working Group**.  
Participants are encouraged to join the community Slack workspace to continue discussions beyond the event.

## Workshop Registration

* Event is in-person only
